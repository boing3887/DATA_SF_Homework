    "##PROJECT OUTLINE\n",
    "\n",
    "The National Basketball Association increasingly features faster and faster-paced gameplay and higher-scoring, notably caused by teams' increasing reliance on the three-point shot. Teams have undertaken a variety of strategies in order to increase the number of three-point shots that they take as well as make. One thing teams have done is to replace a traditional Center or (more often) a Power Forward with a smaller player who is a better long-range shooter (called a \"stretch four\"), or to have players who play the traditional Power Forward/Center positions attempt more three-point shots. The intuition behind this strategy is not only that three-point shots are worth more, but that bigger players - who are often also guarded by other big (and thus slower) players - have more three-point shot opportunities that will not be defended properly since Power Forwards/Centers are not comfortable playing far from the rim. If defending Power Forwards/Centers *do* come out further to defend the three-point shot, that leaves more space closer to the basket for other players to score (usually by dribble-driving or posting up). Thus, \"floor spacing\" is improved. \n",
    "\n",
    "This project seeks to see whether the beneficial effect for an offense of Power Forwards/Centers/Stretch-Fours taking three-point shots is similar to that of players at other positions (meaning Point Guard/\"Ones\", Shooting Guards/\"Twos\" and Small Forward/\"Threes\") in the effect it has on floor spacing, or whether, due to the potential of drawing shot-blocking players away from the rim, their floor spacing effect is different (meaning larger)."
